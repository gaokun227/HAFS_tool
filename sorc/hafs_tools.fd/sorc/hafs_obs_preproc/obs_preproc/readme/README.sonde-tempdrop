*** README FOR THE SONDE PROCESSING PACKAGE OF OBS-PREPROC.

#----

# Installation of the sonde processing package for the obs-preproc
  software.

Please see file INSTALL for installation instructions.

#----

# Collecting TEMP-DROP observation messages for processing.

A Python script, both versions 2 and 3 compatiable, is provided in the
./tools path; this file is called format_sonde.py.

An example sonde file from the NCEP data tank (e.g., DCOM) is provided
in demo/20190901.sonde.

To collect the respective TEMP-DROP observation messages into
individual files, do as follows:

%> cd tools
%> python -c CYCLE -d DATAPATH

where the above variables are as follows:

(a) CYCLE; the forecast cycle for which to collect observations;
    assuming the UNIX convention, this string is to be formatted as
    %Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S.

(b) DATAPATH; this is the path to the directory containing the .sonde
    files from the NCEP data tank; for this example, this is as
    follows:

    ../demo/sondes

Upon successful application, individual files will be created for each
TEMP-DROP message identified within the .sonde file. The file naming
convention is as follows:

<date and timestamp; formatted as (assuming the UNIX convention) %Y%m%d%H%M>.<tasking center; typically KWBC (NOAA HRD or EMC) or KNHC (NOAA NHC)>

If multiple files exist with the same time-stamp (which is used to
define the filename), the new file names will be appended with an
integer. In addition, file names suffixed with '.mod' are
created. These files contain identical TEMP-DROP messages but with the
release and splash point locations written to seperate lines; this is
intended to enable to the TEMP-DROP processing software to correctly
process the start and end times for the observations.

Finally, also created will be filelist.list. This file is used by the
TEMP-DROP processing software in order to process the individual
sondes (see the namelist attribute 'sonde_filelist').

# Running the TEMP-DROP sonde processing package.

(1) An example namelist for the TEMP-DROP sonde processing package
    executable (e.g., exec/obs-preproc.exe) is provided in ./demo. For
    documentation regarding the namelist variable meanings, please
    consult src/namelist_interface.F90.

(2) Copy the namelist demo/tempdrop-sonde/obs-preproc.input to
    exec/obs-preproc.input.

(3) Example TEMP-DROP message files are provided in demo/data,
    including an ASCII formatted file containing the file names; this
    file is parsed by the executable in order to (a) decode the
    TEMP-DROP messages and (b) estimate the drift of the sonde.

(4) To launch the executable, do as follows:

    %> ./obs-preproc.exe

(5) If successful, multiple files will be created in the path denoted
    by the namelist variable 'datapath'; they are as follows:

    (a) hsa-map.table; this file contains the processed (e.g.,
        decoded) TEMP-DROP message file corresponding to original
        (e.g., encoded) TEMP-DROP message file; for example:

	File ./AF303_00_190710.hsa is the decoded TEMP-DROP message
	corresponding to the encoded TEMP-DROP message file
	../demo/data/201907101735.KNHC.

        Please refer to
        https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/format/tempdrop_format.html for
        more information.

    (b) *.hsa; this (these) file(s) contain the decoded TEMP-DROP
        messages from the original TEMP-DROP encoded message file(s);
        the file is column-delimited as follows:

        (i)    wx flag; should always be 1.

	(ii)   date stamp, formatted as 2-digit year (yy), 2-digit month
	       (mm), and 2-digit day (dd).

        (iii)  time stamp, relative to GMT, formatted as 2-digit hour
               (hh) and 2-digit minute (nn).

        (iv)   latitude; positive for Northern hemisphere; units are
               degrees.

        (v)    longitude; positive for Western Hemisphere; units are
               degrees.

        (vi)   pressure level of observation; units are hPa.

	(vii)  temperature observation; units are degrees Celcius.

        (viii) relative humidity; units are percentage (%).

        (ix)   height of observation; units are meters.

        (x)    zonal (u) wind observation; units are meters per second.

        (xi)   meridional (v) wind observation; units are meters per
               second.

	(xii)  observation level type; currently only mandatory (MANL)
	       and significant (SIGL) levels are considered.

    (c) *.hsa.drft; this (these) file(s) contain the decoded TEMP-DROP
        message with the estimate sonde drift; the sonde drift is
        determined by the date- and time-stamp and latitude and
        longitude values along the TEMP-DROP observation profile;
        otherwise, the format of these files is identical to the
        description provided in (b).

    (d) *.hsa.base; this (these) file(s) contain information regarding
        the sonde drift estimates; the file is column-delimited as
        follows:

        (i)   longitude coordinate of splash location; units are
              degrees.

        (ii)  latitude coordinate of splash location; units are
              degrees.

        (iii) the fall time for the sonde; units are seconds.

        (iv)  longitude coordinate for the last collected observation
              as estimated by the sonde drift; units are degrees.

        (v)   latitude coordinate for the last collected observation
              as estimated by the sonde drift; units are degrees.

        (vi)  time-offset between the fall time as deduced from the
              sonde drift and the information collected from the
              TEMP-DROP message.

        These files are not used during the asssimilation of
        observations and are provided as a diagnostic to assess
        algorithm accuracy and may be ignored.

    (e) *.hsa.nc; this (these) file(s) contain the sonde observations
        at SIGL and MANL levels, and the position estimated from the
        drift, formatted in accordance with netcdf; these files are
        provided as a diagnostic for plotting purposes and may be
        ignored.

    NOTE: all file names suffixed with '.hsa*' are formatted as
    follows:

    <aircraft ID>_<observation number>.hsa
